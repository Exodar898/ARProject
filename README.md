# ARProject
An auditing simulation built for the Cal Poly Accounting Program

For a live copy of the web application, head over to www.jamesaloof.com

This application was built as a second senior project during the winter of 2019.
The accounting department at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo had been relying on an Excel VBA simulation
to teach students about basic auditing principles.

When I was in the process of taking the primary auditing class the simulation broke, leaving the department without a way of teaching students.

At this point I stepped in and offered to rebuild the entire simulation as a web application, as well as extend the project
beyond its original scope.

The instructions panel within the application should sufficiently explain how to complete the simulation. Keep in mind that the
simulation is designed for young accountants with a general understanding of auditing.
